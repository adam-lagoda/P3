Control System of a waypoint-oriented 2D map navigation robot for use in wheelchairs
The initiating problem of this project is how electronic systems can be used to help disabled people. The problem has been analyzed in regards to disabilities in everyday life, where the existing and possible solutions, legislation, hazard and risk management was examined. From the analysis it was decided to develop a wheelchair with automatic navigation that follows a premade map of a room with waypoints (such as bedroom, kitchen, etc.) via. voice commands from the user, and obstacle and collision avoidance if the robot meets an obstacle. Special software was developed in Python 3.8 to make the room map with the waypoints, generate the routes, and export data about the routes to the robot. For driving the robot, two stepper motors with drivers was mounted on a differential drive robot frame and powered by battery. A voice command board was used for the voice control of the robot. Two IR sensors were used for the obstacle/collision detection along with an obstacle avoidance algorithm. For control and monitoring, a LCD display with a control panel was mounted on the robot. The prototype fulfilled the set requirements in the conditions it was tested under, but for a real world application, further development and improvements are needed.
